## About

**Structure** is my solution for one of the challanges posted by a Cracow IT company.
Script takes list of Steps, as serialized input (Request) and returns hierarchical structure as serialized output (Response)

## Challanges

Solving this problem was not an easy task and I have learned a lot working on it. Main problems I got the beter knowledge of:

* Google Protobuffs
* Hash nodes
* Object oriented programming
